## ðŸ§  Assumptions Made

- The API response format follows what RapidAPI provides (with resharedPost, image, video, author etc.)
- Reshared content includes either an author or a company name.
- API pagination and error handling are minimal for demo purposes.
- All posts are considered public and require no LinkedIn authentication.
